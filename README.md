# MemoryLane
MemoryLane is a digital healthcare App for Alzheimerâ€™s patients. My grandfather's battle with severe Alzheimer's disease was my motivation to create MemoryLane. The main goal of MemoryLane is to help patients with day to day tasks by showing them short clips and help stimulate memory recall by asking questions related to pictures in the album.  I used SwiftUI for the interface, coreML and Vision for image classification, and UIKit to work with images and videos.
